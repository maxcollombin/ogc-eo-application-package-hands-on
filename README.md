# EO Application Packages - hands-on

The [OGC Best Practice for Earth Observation Application Package](https://docs.ogc.org/bp/20-089r1.html) describes how to package EO computational workflows targeting their execution automation, scalability, reusability and portability while also being workflow-engine and vendor neutral.

This hands-on training targets EO application developers and provides an introduction to the Earth Observation Application Package concept and a set of real-life examples running on an Integrated Development Environment on Binder.

## Launch the hands-on environment on Binder
